## Semantic and Non-semantic Elements

Semantic HTML elements mean elements with meaning and clearly defines its
content. Non-semantic HTML elements tell nothing about its content.

<br /><br />

## Semantic Element Examples

`<article>` Defines independent, self-contained content<br /> `<aside>` Defines
content aside from the page content<br /> `<details>` Defines additional details
that the user can view or hide<br /> `<figcaption>` Defines a caption for a
`<figure>` element<br /> `<figure>` Specifies self-contained content, like
illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.<br /> `<footer>` Defines a
footer for a document or section<br /> `<header>` Specifies a header for a
document or section<br /> `<main>` Specifies the main content of a
document<br /> `<mark>` Defines marked/highlighted text<br /> `<nav>` Defines
navigation links<br /> `<section>` Defines a section in a document<br />
`<summary>` Defines a visible heading for a `<details>` element<br /> `<time>`
Defines a date/time<br />

<br />

## Non-semantic Elements

`<div>` and `<span>`s are non-semantic HTML elements that act as containers
solely for styling purposes. As generic containers, they do not come with any
overarching meaning or semantic value.

<br />

## Why Use Semantic Elements

- Accessibility<br/> Semantic HTML makes webpages available to mobile devices
  as well as people with disabilities. This is due to the improved ability of
  screen readers and browsers to interpret the code.

- SEO<br/> It enhances the website. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the
  process of increasing the number of visitors to your website. With improved
  SEO, search engines are better able to identify your website's content and
  appropriately weight the most important content.

- Simple to Understand<br/> Semantic HTML makes the source code of a website
  easier to read for other web developers.
