## About the Project

This capstone project is to test your understanding on HTML and CSS - your starting point to web development. You will have HTML and CSS up your sleeve if you can complete the project with ease.

Let's build and publish your own personal landing page by applying all the knowledge you gained so far.

### You will need to work with the following language/technology:

#### Core

- HTML
- CSS
- Git & GitHub

#### Optionals

- CSS frameworks (i.e. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), etc.)
- Javascript for additional functionality / user interactivity

## Project Requirements

The following aspects should be covered in building your personal landing page:

### Part 1: HTML

- You should declare appropriate document type and include necessary page info under the head section.

- HTML has to be written semantically wherever possible.

- The page should contain all elements that form a structured web page - header, navigation, body, and footer.

- The navigation links should direct users to respective sections (or pages - if you decided to go with multiple pages) of the page/site.

- The page should also contain links that direct users to external pages. It could be your social media handlers (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, etc) or links to your business / hobby / any other work you do.

- Making it more interesting by embedding images/audio/video/iframe wherever you find fit.

- The page should contain a form allowing users to submit input. This could me a textarea allowing users to send you a message, or a text input to collect visitor's email for newsletter subscription, and so on.

### Part 2: CSS

- You should write your CSS code in an external stylesheet and link it to your HTML file. Exception to this if you are using CSS frameworks.

- Your page should utilise an external font (e.g. [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/))

- Ensure proper layout and positioning (relative/absolute positioning/float/flexbox/grid)

- Incorporate CSS pseudo elements/classes wherever you find fit.

- Ensure your page is fully responsive (you may achieve this through applying media queries, responsive font sizes)

- Last but not least: use all the CSS properties you've learn (or find out those that you aren't sure) to achieve your intended visual and style and will be proud to showcase it to your peers! The possibilities with CSS is endless.

### Part 3: Git / GitHub

- You should create an online repository on GitHub to host your project.

- You should update your online repository by pushing the changes done locally to your online repository using git as you make progress.

- Once you have completed the project, host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and share the link with us!
