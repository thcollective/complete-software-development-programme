As web designers and front-end developers, we have the luxury of attending a
number of great conferences dedicated to our craft. We’re going to make up our
own conference, Styles Conference, and build a website for it throughout the
following lessons.

## Step 1

Let’s open our text editor, create a new file named index.html, and save it to a
location we won’t forget. I’m going to create a folder on my Desktop named
“styles- conference” and save this file there; feel free to do the same.

## Step 2

Within the index.html file, let’s add the document structure, including the
`<!DOCTYPE html>` document type and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
elements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Step 3

Inside the `<head>` element, let’s add `<meta>` and `<title>` elements. The
`<meta>` element should include the proper charset attribute and value, while
the `<title>` element should contain the title of the page—let’s say “Styles
Conference.”

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Styles Conference</title>
</head>
```

## Step 4

Inside the `<body>` element, let’s add `<h1>` and `<p>` elements. The `<h1>`
element should include the heading we wish to include—let’s use “Styles
Conference” again—and the `<p>` element should include a simple paragraph to
introduce our conference.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Styles Conference</h1>
  <p>
    Every year the brightest web designers and front-end developers descend on
    Chicago to discuss the latest technologies. Join us this August!
  </p>
</body>
```

## Step 5

Now it’s time to see how we’ve done! Let’s go find our index.html file (mine is
within the “styles-conference” folder on my Desktop). Double-clicking this file
or dragging it into a web browser will open it for us to review.

## Final

Let’s switch gears a bit, moving away from HTML, and take a look at CSS.
Remember, HTML will define the content and structure of our web pages, while CSS
will define the visual style and appearance of our web pages.
